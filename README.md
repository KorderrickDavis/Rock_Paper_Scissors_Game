# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Game

Rock Paper Scissors is a game played between two people, where each player forms one of three shapes: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the following rules: rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beat paper. In this game, the user makes a choice, and the computer also makes a choice. The results are then displayed, showing both the computer’s and the user’s choices.
